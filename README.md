# Web Developer Coding Assessment

Listed below are the requirements for our React coding assignment. We anticipate the coding
assignment to take between 2-4 hours to complete. Please reach out via email if you have any
questions or need any additional information/clarification. Good luck and we look forward to
seeing what you come up with!

• Using React, write a website that calls the Unsplash API to search a list of photos and displays the thumbnails in a grid. https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos i.e. GET /search/photos?page=1&query=dog

• When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, the next page of photos should be loaded automatically and displayed (infinite scroll).

• Clicking a photo should navigate the user to a details route that displays the full-size photo along with some of the photo metadata (user name, like count, etc.)

-   TODO: Add more metadata

• On the main page, user should be able to filter by color and orientation see parameters section of documentation https://unsplash.com/documentation#parameters-16

-   TODO: Add Filters

• Styling should be responsive, i.e. when shrunk down to mobile width, only one column should be displayed. Feel free to use any CSS framework/styling library you please.

• Code should be provided via a Git repository pushed to your Git provider of choice (if repo is private, it should be shared with the interviewer). Alternatively, email a .zip of the Git repo to the interviewer.
